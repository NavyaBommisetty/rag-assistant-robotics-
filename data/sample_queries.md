Autonomy in Robotics 
Until recently, most robots were hard- coded to execute a task according to a pre- defined 
trajectory and with a pre- defined level of force. These robots are oblivious to their external 
environment. This means that the object the robot works on (such as a car part) must always be 
presented in exactly  the same position, and the robot is not able to adjust its force ...

Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) have revolution- 
ized the ﬁeld of advanced robotics in recent years. AI, ML, and DL are transforming the ﬁeld 
of advanced robotics, making robots more intelligent, eﬃcient, and adaptable to complex tasks 
and environments. Some of the applications of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics include au- 
tonomous navigation...

5. Computer Vision: Computer vision is a critical component of robotics, allowing robots to perceive and interact with their envi- 
ronment. Further research in this area could focus on improving the accuracy and robustness of object recognition, tracking, and 
scene understanding algorithms. 
6. Neural networks: By using neural networks, robots can learn from experience and become more eﬃcient over time.

performance measure. The European 
Commission, meanwhile, defines AI as ‘Systems that display intelligent behavior  by 
analyzing their environment and taking actions – with some degree of autonomy – to achieve 
specific goals’
2.  There is also no agreement on which algorithms or methods constitute AI. Part of the 
difficulty with setting a concrete definition is that AI algorithms and models (such as neural network...
3. offer significant benefits, enabling robots to adapt to a changing external environment in 
real-time without recoding. AI is also starting to be used in optimizing process design and robot 
programming and is increasingly adopted in robotic quality inspection. 
This paper looks at the most common uses of AI in commercial robotic applications and 
discusses market trends. It also disc usses safety standards and regulation for AI in robotics.

It’s important to note that: 
 AI is not per se required to enable the above tasks but can bring significant 
performance benefits and enable specific functionality. A general rule of thumb is that 
the more var iability and unpredictability there is in the external environment, the more useful AI will be. 

Question: why do we use AI in robotics
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Answer (from your documents):

1. In advanced robotic systems, AI is used to create robots that can perceive, reason, and act autonomously in complex environments. 
Machine Learning is used to enable robots to learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time. Deep Learning 
is used to solve speciﬁc problems that are diﬃcult to solve with traditional Machine Learning techniques, such as image and speech 
recognition. By combining these technologies, advanced robotics systems can be designed to perform complex ...
2. 2. Advantages of AI, ML and DL applications in advanced robotics 
AI (Artiﬁcial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), and DL (Deep Learning) applications have brought about signiﬁcant advance- 
ments in the ﬁeld of robotics [48] . Some of these advantages of AI, ML and DL applications in advanced robotics include: 
1. Automation: AI, ML, and DL can automate many repetitive and mundane tasks in robotics, freeing up human resources to focus 
on more complex tasks [49] . 
2. Enhanced accuracy
